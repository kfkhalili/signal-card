# Executive Summary: FinCard Explorer (Working Title)

## 1. Introduction & Core Concept

FinCard Explorer is a forthcoming web application designed to revolutionize financial education and investment analysis. It transforms complex financial data into an interactive, digestible, and engaging experience through a unique "Card-based" system. Users can explore stocks, cryptocurrencies, and other financial instruments by interacting with over 100 distinct types of dynamic "Financial Cards" (e.g., Company Profile, Price, Earnings, Volume, Dividends, Sentiment, News), each powered by live data.

## 2. Problem Addressed

Traditional financial information platforms often overwhelm users, especially beginners, with vast amounts of non-contextualized data. This creates a steep learning curve and can make investment analysis feel boring, inaccessible, and isolating. There's a lack of intuitive tools that blend deep data exploration with community insights and personalized learning paths.

## 3. Our Solution â€“ Interactive & Social Financial Cards

FinCard Explorer addresses these challenges by offering:

- **Modular Card System:** Users build personalized dashboards by adding various Financial Cards to a dynamic workspace. Each card displays self-contained, live-updated information.
- **Deep Interactivity:** Metrics within cards (e.g., current price, 52-week high/low, SMA 50) are clickable, instantly generating new, related cards in the workspace, allowing for intuitive drill-down and discovery.
- **Gamified Learning & Engagement:** Each live card state possesses a "rarity" (Common to Legendary), subtly guiding users, especially beginners, to understand the significance or unusual nature of current data points.
- **Social & Community Features:** Users can like, comment on, and share specific card states (snapshots). They can also save these snapshots to personal "Collections," creating a historical record of their analysis or interesting market moments, which can be explored by other users.
- **Sleek, User-Centric Design:** The interface is designed to be minimalist, visualization-rich, and gamified, leveraging modern UI components for an engaging financial exploration experience.

## 4. Target Audience

FinCard Explorer caters to two primary user groups:

- **Beginner Investors:** Individuals seeking to learn about investing and understand market data without being overwhelmed. They benefit from the simplified card format, rarity indicators, and community insights.
- **Professionals & Experienced Investors:** Users who require powerful tools for in-depth financial metric exploration, company comparisons, and the creation of sophisticated, shareable dashboards and "Collections."

## 5. Unique Selling Proposition (USP)

- **Novel Exploration Method:** An intuitive and engaging way to navigate complex financial data through interactive, self-contained cards.
- **Integrated Social & Gamification:** Rarity indicators and social features provide context, encourage learning, and build community.
- **Personalized & Dynamic Dashboards:** Users tailor their workspace to their specific interests with live data updates.
- **Dual Audience Appeal:** Simplifies complexity for beginners while offering depth and customization for professionals.

## 6. Business Model

FinCard Explorer will operate on a freemium model with revenue generated through:

- **Premium Subscriptions:** Features like multiple workspaces, public dashboard publishing, custom entry cards, and potentially advanced analytics.
- **E-commerce:** Selling physical, high-quality printed versions of users' saved card "snapshots."

## 7. Technical Architecture & Development Status

The application is currently in the development phase, being built with a modern, robust technology stack:

- **Frontend & UI:** A responsive and interactive user interface is developed using **Next.js (React)** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**. Component development is accelerated using **Shadcn UI**, which provides a set of reusable and customizable components. The entire frontend codebase is written in **TypeScript**.
- **Hosting:** The Next.js application is hosted on **Vercel**.
- **Backend & Core Data Management:** **Supabase** serves as the comprehensive backend solution, providing the PostgreSQL database, user authentication (via `auth.users` and a linked `public.user_profiles` table for custom profile data), and serverless functions.
- **External Data Source & Ingestion:**
  - Primary data is sourced from the **FinancialModelingPrep (FMP) API**.
  - **Supabase Edge Functions** are scheduled to run at regular intervals (e.g., every X minutes) to fetch data from specific FMP endpoints:
    - `https://financialmodelingprep.com/stable/profile?symbol={SYMBOL}` populates the `public.profiles` table, storing detailed company information (name, sector, description, financials, etc.).
    - `https://financialmodelingprep.com/stable/quote?symbol={SYMBOL}` populates the `public.live_quote_indicators` table, storing live market data (current price, change, volume, SMAs, year high/low, etc.).
    - `https://financialmodelingprep.com/api/v3/is-the-market-open?exchange={EXCHANGE}` is used to enrich the `public.live_quote_indicators` table with market status information (e.g., `is_market_open`, `market_status_message`).
  - This architecture allows for future expansion to other data providers.
- **Real-time Data Propagation:** When the `profiles` and `live_quote_indicators` tables are updated by the edge functions, **Supabase Realtime** capabilities broadcast these changes. Clients subscribe to these broadcasts, ensuring Financial Cards in their workspace reflect live data.
- **Core Application Tables in Supabase:**
  - `public.card_snapshots`: Stores immutable snapshots of individual card states, including the underlying `card_data_snapshot` (JSONB), calculated `rarity_level`, and `symbol`. This is central to the "save state" and historical tracking features.
  - `public.snapshot_comments`: Enables threaded user comments on specific `card_snapshots`.
  - `public.snapshot_likes`: Manages user likes for `card_snapshots`.
  - `public.user_collections`: Allows users to curate personal collections of their favorite or most relevant `card_snapshots`.
- **Testing:** A testing strategy incorporating Jest is being implemented.
