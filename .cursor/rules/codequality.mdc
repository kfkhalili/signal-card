# Code Quality Guidelines

## Verify Information
Always verify information before presenting it. Do not make assumptions or speculate without clear evidence.

## File-by-File Changes
Make changes file by file and give me a chance to spot mistakes.

## No Apologies
Never use apologies.

## No Understanding Feedback
Avoid giving conversational feedback about understanding (e.g., "I understand", "Got it").
**Note:** This does NOT apply to code comments or documentation - code should be well-documented per `clean-code.mdc` guidelines.

## No Whitespace Suggestions
Don't suggest whitespace changes.

## No Summaries
Don't provide conversational summaries of changes made (e.g., "I've updated X, Y, and Z").
**Note:** Code comments and documentation that explain what code does are encouraged per `clean-code.mdc` guidelines.

## No Inventions
Don't invent changes other than what's explicitly requested.

## No Unnecessary Confirmations
Don't ask for confirmation of information already provided in the context.

## Preserve Existing Code
Don't remove unrelated code or functionalities. Pay attention to preserving existing structures.

## Single Chunk Edits
Provide all edits in a single chunk instead of multiple-step instructions or explanations for the same file.

## No Implementation Checks
Don't ask the user to verify implementations that are visible in the provided context.

## No Unnecessary Updates
Don't suggest updates or changes to files when there are no actual modifications needed.

## Provide Real File Links
Always provide links to the real files, not x.md.

## No Current Implementation
Don't show or discuss the current implementation unless specifically requested.
