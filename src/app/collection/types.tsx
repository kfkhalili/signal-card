// This file can be merged with the page.tsx if simple enough, or kept separate for clarity.
// We already defined DisplayableCollectedCard in page.tsx, if we keep it there, this file isn't needed.
// For now, let's assume DisplayableCollectedCard is defined in page.tsx as shown above.
// If it grows, move it here.
// For now, this file can be skipped and DisplayableCollectedCard can live in page.tsx or a more global types file.
export {}; // Empty export to make it a module if no other types are here yet
